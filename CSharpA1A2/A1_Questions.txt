1. Proper types for provided situations:
	- int
	- float
	- int
	- string
	- decimal
	- int
	- decimal
	- decimal
	- long
	- ulong
	- long

2. Boxing is converting a value type to a reference type. Unboxing is vice versa. 
	- value type holds the value, reference holds the memory location.
	- value type stored in stack, reference type in heap.
	- value types: int, float, bool, etc. ref types: string, obj, etc.
	- value types not garbage collected, ref types are.

3. Managed resources are .NET code and are managed by runtime. Unmanaged resources are not; like file handles,
pinned memory, and database connections.

4. It manages allocation and release of memory automatically. It can prevent memory leaks and nonfreed objects

--------Part 2---------
1. DivideByZeroException will be thrown.

2. It will return infinity or NaN.

3. It will overflow the int, C# won't throw OverflowException by default.

4. Use y, then incrememnt by 1 vs. increment by 1 first, then use y.

5. break terminates the current loop. Continue starts a new iteration of the loop. 
Return terminates the loop and returns control to the caller.

6. Initializer section is used to initialize variables for the loop. Condition section determines
if the loop keeps running. Iterator section occurs after each loop is executed. All sections are optional

7. = assigns values. == compares equality.

8. Yes. It's an infinite loop.

9. _ replaces default, it should match anything if reached.

10. IEnumerable.
